This plugin is a simple plugin for Providence, allowing to easily logout and access to preferences from a menu. It aims to be a replacement for the user links (logout and preferences) in the footer of Providence.

Meanwhile, it solves the problem of a footer always present on screen. On a small screen (tablet), this plugin allows the user to have more space on screen.
